My present development activities consist of extending and improving the software system for mobile robot control, which was proposed and illustrated as a proof-of-concept during my PhD thesis. Also learning the Rust programming language.<p>Coming from a background of mobile and web application development, I have been involved in iOS and backend projects and have had the opportunity to use a multitude of languages so far, including: Python, C++, Java, JS, Objective-C, Swift (early versions). I am quite versatile with regards to learning and using programming languages and tools.<p>My current research topics of interest are vision-based control and machine vision, with applications in mobile robotics.<h1 id=skills>SKILLS</h1><h2 id=software-development>Software development</h2><ul><li>C/C++ application development, including Qt Framework GUI and network programming<li>Python application development: desktop GUI (PySide),</ul><h2 id=machine-vision-deep-learning>Machine vision/ Deep Learning</h2><ul><li>Image segmentation & processing using OpenCV<li>Basic skills with PyTorch - defining & training neural net models</ul><h2 id=web-development>Web development</h2><ul><li>Basic React, Javascript frontend skills<li>Backend development using Python (Flask, Tornado) and Java (Spring Boot)</ul><h2 id=other-skills>Other skills</h2><ul><li>Teaching/ delivering training on tech topics<li>Research & scientific writing</ul><h2 id=various-technical-skills>Various technical skills</h2><ul><li>3D modelling (Siemens NX)<li>(Kinematic) model simulations with Simulink<li>Linux</ul><h1 id=education>EDUCATION</h1><blockquote><p><em>Complete educational background on my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-mihalca>LinkedIn profile</a>.</em></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Robotics</strong></p> <ul><li>Thesis: <em>Artificial intelligence aspects of interactions between agents of mobile robot systems</em> (<a href=https://cloud.uoradea.ro/index.php/s/AA5j5QaoCr64JRE>summary</a>)<li>My research project explored applications of vision-based control for groups of mobile robots (using classical Computer Vision and also Deep Learning), as well as the design and implementation of a prototyping support platform for experimental research.</ul><li><p><strong>Computer Engineering degree</strong></p></ul><h1 id=work-experience>WORK EXPERIENCE</h1><blockquote><p><em>Selected roles -- Additional details on my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-mihalca>LinkedIn profile</a>.</em></blockquote><dl><dt>Associate teaching assistant<dd>Teaching Computer Programming (using C# .NET)<dt>Python Trainer (remote)<dd>Delivered comprehensive 4-hours/day Python classes for IT professionals seeking to gain new knowledge/ skills<dt>Research assistant @ University of Oradea<dd>Information synthesis & research - Quadcopter swarm algorithms for search & rescue missions in disaster relief<dt>Linux, Qt and Win32 C++ developer<dd>Control software and user interface for a variometer device<dt>iOS mobile apps developer & Java backend<dd>iPhone application development for financial and various industries<dt>PHP backend developer<dd>Implemented a regular expression-based macro language on top of MySQL stored procedure for a CRM software backend written in PHP</dl></section></article></main><footer><span id=copyright_notice>Â© 2025 Vlad Mihalca</span><span id=created_with>Created with <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a></span></footer></div>
